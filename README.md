## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scss preprocessor
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
How to use react-accessible-accordion library, customizing progress-bar to appear the same on different browsers

### Continued development
I want to learn backend development and make this web-site fully functional.

But untill that point I think it's OK :)

### Useful resources

- [react js accordion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-accessible-accordion) - This helped me for making products section to extend and collapse.
